Canvas Input
===========
This library allows you to create input boxes without using the standard HTML DOM element &lt;input&gt;, instead through use of a &lt;canvas&gt; element. 

I initially created this for [Clay.io](http://clay.io), a hub for HTML5 games. We offer an API for game developers to implement features like high scores, achievements, data storage, payment
processing, etc. in their HTML5 games. There are a few services out there that boost performance for HTML5 games on mobile devices by eliminating the DOM completely, so we needed to develop
a version of our API that plays nicely *without* the DOM. In doing so, we also needed a way to let users login to their Clay.io accounts, and thus this library was born.

Another use-case for this might be to eliminate spammers without use of a captcha. At least at this point in time, they're not going to catch onto the fact that you are using 'fake' inputs
in a &lt;canvas&gt; rather than using &lt;input&gt;s, and won't be able to insert of a bunch of junk.

Demo
----
You can play with a demo [here](http://clay.io/plugins/canvasinput/test.html).

Installation
-----------
Put the following inbetween &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; (or just before the end of &lt;/body&gt;, just wait til the page is loaded to call the classes)

   <script type='text/javascript' src='src/canvasinput.js'></script>

Usage
-----
There are 3 classes you can use right now, `CanvasText`, `CavasPassword` and `CanvasSubmit`. When you call the class, pass the canvas DOM object for the first parameter, and an options object
for the second parameter. The following options are available:
* **x** *(integer x position of the input in the canvas, pass 'center' to center it)*
* **y** *(integer y position of the input in the canvas)*
* **width** *(integer width value of box)*
* **height** *(integer height value of box)*
* **fontSize** *(integer font size - default 12)*
* **padding** *(integer padding - default 5)*
* **center** *(boolean, set `true` to align the text inside the box to the center. Default `false` for text and password, `true` for submit)*
* **placeholder** *(string, default text for the box, this is cleared out when the input is focused)*
* **onSubmit** *(function, only for CanvasSubmit, this function is called when the user clicks on the button, or the enter key is pressed from a CanvasInput)*

Standard text input

    var username = new CanvasText( canvas, {
        x: 'center',
        y: 120,
        width: 300,
        placeholder: 'Enter your username...'
    } );
    // Access the value with:
    console.log( username.value );

Standard password input

    var password = new CanvasPassword( canvas, {
        x: 'center',
        y: 155,
        width: 300,
        placeholder: 'Enter your password...'
    } );
    // Access the value with:
    console.log( password.value );

Standard submit button

    new CanvasSubmit( canvas, {
        x: 'center',
        y: 195,
        width: 300,
        placeholder: 'Submit',
        onSubmit: ( function() {
            return alert( 'Submit button pressed' );
        } )
    } );
    
Modifying the source
--------------------
Feel free to pull request improvements to this library. Some things I can think of off the top of my head are support for select boxes, radio buttons
and checkboxes, as well as support for clicking to move the cursor and select text.

The library is written in CoffeeScript (`src/canvasinput.coffee`) and compiled to JavaScript (`src/canvasinput.javascript`)
    
Support
-------
This has been tested IE9, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Mobile Safari (and Chrome...)
